## Process Steps in Detail

### Research

The research step is essentially the gathering of authoritative sources which all the following steps are based upon.  When someone suggests a song, all that is typically given is the title of the song.  But in order to use the song we need to know several things:

1. What copyrights apply to the song?  If it is a modern arrangement of an older song - would the older song that is not under copyright be suitable?
2. Is it covered under our CCLI license?  If not, can we obtain a license?  How much would that cost?  Can we get permission from the copyright holder?
3. What arrangements are available?  Will we need to make our own arrangement?
4. What is the history of the hymn?  Have verses been changed over time?  Added?  Removed?  Might we want to make our own modifications to the lyrics (restoring old verses, removing verses, changing some words)?

The researcher may make their own recommendations or not at his or her discretion.  Ultimately the job of the researcher is to assemble all this information and submit it to the critical review team to make the decision on the best path forward.

### Critical Review

The critical review team's job is to take the material collected by the researcher and decide whether to add the hymn to the hymnal or reject the hymn.

Possible reasons for rejecting the hymn include:

1. The hymn is too difficult for congregational singing
2. No SATB acapella arrangement of the song can be found, and no one can be found who is willing and able to create such an arrangement.
3. The hymn is copyrighted material, is not covered under our CCLI license; and obtaining rights to use the hymn are considered to be too expensive.
4. The song is scripturally unsound.  Modifications either cannot be made to correct the errors due to copyright restrictions.  Or the errors are so profound as to be uncorrectable.
5. The song lacks sufficient worship benefit.  It lacks depth or breadth of meaning.

The critical review team may also make recommendations on changes to the lyrics (if allowed), and which verses should be included or excluded.
