### Original Verses

1. In Christ alone my hope is found,  
   He is my light, my strength, my song;  
   This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,  
   Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.  
   What heights of love, what depths of peace,    
   When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!  
   My Comforter, my All in All,  
   Here in the love of Christ I stand.

2. In Christ alone! - who took on flesh,  
   Fullness of God in helpless babe.  
   This gift of love and righteousness,  
   Scorned by the ones He came to save:  
   Till on that cross as Jesus died,  
   The wrath of God was satisfied -  
   For every sin on Him was laid;  
   Here in the death of Christ I live.

3. There in the ground His body lay,  
   Light of the world by darkness slain:  
   Then bursting forth in glorious day  
   Up from the grave He rose again!  
   And as He stands in victory  
   Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,  
   For I am His and He is mine -  
   Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

4. No guilt in life, no fear in death,  
   This is the power of Christ in me;  
   From life's first cry to final breath,  
   Jesus commands my destiny.  
   No power of hell, no scheme of man,  
   Can ever pluck me from His hand:  
   Till He returns or calls me home,  
   Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.

### Variations in the text

At least two denominations have objected to the phrase in verse 3: "The wrath of God was satisfied" and sought to change that phrase to: "the love of God was magnified".  The Southern Baptists did change it without seeking permission from the copyright holders.  The Presbyterians sought permission and were denied; and subsequently removed "In Christ Alone" from their new hymnal.

### Tune

The words and the music were developed together as a unit.  The tune doesn't have a separate background.

### Objections

#### Wrath of God Objection

Verse 2b reads:

   Till on that cross as Jesus died,  
   The wrath of God was satisfied -  
   For every sin on Him was laid;  
   Here in the death of Christ I live.

The objection raised is that this is a reference to the doctrine of Penal Substitution

#### Eternal Security Objection


### Researcher Recommendation

Recommendation from the researcher about whether or not the hymn/tune should be accepted
and what modifications should be done (which verses to use, any rewording etc.)

## Critical Review

During my research I encountered a couple objections that some have raised regarding the use of this song. After consulting with Robert Harkrider, Josh Creel, Walcott Steele, Greg Kline, and Ralph Kline we all came to the conclusion that the objections were without merit and that the song is very much appropriate for use in our worship.
