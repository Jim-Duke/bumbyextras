# Magnificat
Magnificat by Randy Gill is a popular hymn similar to The Greatest Command in that it is setup where each voice part sings a different tune and words; and it starts with one part and builds adding one part a round; until all the parts are singing their individual parts and words together.  The words and music are designed to complement one another.
