# Hark! I Hear the Harps Eternal
A hymn that invokes imagery of approaching the end of life and hearing those who have gone on before singing praises to Jesus and to God.

### Reason for the Submission

There is a well known choral arrangement of Hark! I Hear the Harps Eternal arranged by Alice Parker.  I first heard it as performed by the FC Chorus; and then by the Robert Shaw Chorale.  The song is really upbeat and presents images of eager anticipation of our time in heaven where we can sing: "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise the Lamb!".

I really wanted to be able to use the song in worship, but the Alice Parker arrangement was too difficult for congregational use, as well as being under copyright.  I eventually dug into the hymns past and found it in Southern Harmony and asked Michael Duke to create a simple arrangement suitable for congregational use.  The result is the song I'd like to use.

### Hymn

From these sources, I have learned that the hymn was written by F. W. Warren.  But precious little is known about him.

### Original Verses

The original verses, as found in Olive Leaf are as follows:

1. Hark! I hear the harps eternal  
   Ringing on the farther shore,  
   As I near those swollen waters,  
   With their deep and solemn roar.

2. And my soul, tho' stained with sorrow,  
   Fading as the light of day,  
   Passes swiftly o'er those waters,  
   To the city far away.

3. Souls have cross'd before me saintly,  
   To that land of perfect rest;  
   And I hear them singing faintly,  
   In the mansions of the blest.

4. Just beyond the river flasheth,  
   Jebu-Salem of my God,  
   Where the white wave, rising, plasheth  
   On the shore by angels trod.  

5. Stop! I see the boatman nearing;  
   See! the snowy sail is set,  
   And the oars are floating idly,  
   And the sail is drifting wet.

6. Call my father! call my mother!  
   Tell them that the boatman's here;  
   And another -- Oh, another!  
   Unto whom my soul is dear.

7. Call them quick! for I am passing  
   Thro' the valley of the grave;  
   I am passing, with the boatman  
   O'er the deep and solemn wave!

**Chorus:**  
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise the Lamb!  
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Glory to the Great I Am!

### Variations in the text

In the version in Southern Harmony, two verses of the original were combined together to fit the tune MORENA.  Verse 3 was dropped, as was the chorus.

The Alice Parker version only used verses 1, 2, and 3; and dropped verses 4-7.

### Tune

Southern Harmony used the tune paired with a hymn with the first line: "Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched, Weak and wounded, sick and sore".  It seems that the name of the tune was chosen to fit this hymn.  I have found no other hymn paired with the tune.

### Researcher Recommendation

The verses chosen by Alice Parker are the best ones from the original hymn.  The imagery of a river brings up the metaphor of the crossing over the Jordon River to the promised land.  However, the imagery of the boatman mixes this with Greek mythology with Charon the ferryman and the dead crossing the river Styx to reach the land of the dead.  I have no desire to mix images from Greek mythology with biblical images.  But verses 1-3, together with the rousing chorus presents a wonderful picture of a growing awareness of death approaching with the hope of joining others who have gone on before us and to sing praises to Jesus and God in heaven for eternity.

I therefore recommend that we use verses 1-3 together with Michael Duke's simplified arrangement.
