This is one of several Isaac Watts hymn that adapt Psalms to common meters.  It 
has most commonly been set to tune RESIGNATION, a traditional American folk song
found in the hymnbook Southern Harmony.

### Reason for the Submission

In one of the many auditioned choirs Michael Duke participated in, one included
a choral arrangement by Mack Wilberg of My Shepherd Will Supply My Need.  A
YouTube recording of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing the Mack Wilberg
arrangement can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzARLyXJjec).
The words and music were so moving that I wanted to see if we could find the
original and use it in our worship.

### About the Hymn

The hymn appears to have been written in 1719.  This hymn is one of many where
Isaac Watts adapted the psalms to fit various common meters used in hymn singing
in his day.  This adaptation of Psalm 23 was adapted to fit the common meter
(CM - 8.6.8.6).

### Original Verses

1. My Shepherd will supply my Need;  
   Jehovah is his Name;  
   In Pastures fresh he makes me feed,  
   Beside the living Stream.

2. He brings my wand'ring Spirit back  
   When I forsake his Ways,  
   And leads me for his Mercy's Sake  
   In Paths of Truth and Grace.

3. When I walk through the Shades of Death,  
   Thy Presence is my Stay;  
   A Word of thy supporting Breath  
   Drives all my Fears away.

4. Thy Hand in Spite of all my Foes  
   Doth still my Table spread;  
   My Cup with Blessings overflows,  
   Thine Oil anoints my Head.

5. The sure Provisions of my God  
   Attend me all my Days;  
   O may thy House be mine Abode,  
   And all my Work be Praise!

6. There would I find a settled Rest,  
   (While others go and come)  
   No more a Stranger or a Guest,  
   But like a Child at Home. 

Capitalization and punctuation carefully follows the original Isaac Watts
publication.

### Variations in the text

Besides minor modifications in capitalization and punctuation, the most
significant variation is found in Lutheran hymnals where they modified the first
verse by changing "will" to "you", and replacing "Jehovah is his Name" with
"most holy is your name".  In most places where "He" appears it has been
replaced with "You".

One version omitted the 6th verse.  That wouldn't work with the tune pairing
typically used because two verses of the original have to be combined to form a
single verse to suit the length of the tune.

### Tune

The most dominant pairing of this hymn is with the traditional American tune
that first appeared in Southern Harmony 1854 edition under the tune name
RESIGNATION.

### Researcher Recommendation

I recommend that we use the modern harmonization found in the Lutheran hymnal
but use the original text.  Don't follow the Capitalization scheme of Watts,
but use standard modern practices.
