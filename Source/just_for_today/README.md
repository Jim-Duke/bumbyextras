# Just For Today (Father God)
Just For Today is a popular contemporary Christian.  It is simple and fun to sing.  It is a prayer to God to direct our walk: "May my steps be worship; may my thoughts be praise; may my words bring honor to your name."

Thus song was written by Marc Alan Schelske. We visited with a congregation where this was sung and it was very uplifting. I believe we can benefit from this simple song.

### Arrangements

I know of two arrangements for SATB: Shane Coffman's and Jesse Bartley's.  Shane Coffman's arrangement is more suitable for congregational use and Jesse Bartley's arrangement was obviously written for their TTBB acapella group.  However, there are aspects of both that are appealing.  I propose taking elements from both arrangements to create a new arrangement.

## Original Verses

When first written, the song originally had one verse followed by the refrain:

> Father God, just for today  
  help me walk Your narrow way.  
  Help me stand when I could fall.  
  Lend me the strength to hear Your call.

Refrain:  
> May my steps be worship  
  May my thoughts be praise.  
  May my words bring honor to Your name.  
  May my steps be worship  
  May my thoughts be praise.  
  May my words bring honor to Your name.

Later, Marc Schelske added a 2nd verse:

> Here I am, just for today  
  Live in me, have Your way.  
  For my desire, when this race is run  
  is only to hear You say “Well Done.”

### Variations

Narrow way's version is well suited to their TTBB acapella group.  They only sing the first verse and have tight harmonies suitable for a group such as theirs.  They modified the words slightly to suit the meter of their arrangement.  For example, they changed "help me walk Your narrow way" to "help me to walk Your narrow way".  Essentially the same words; but they added "to" to fit their slightly different meter.  There are other small changes in the words "Lend me the strength" is rendered "Give me the strength".  I don't see much of a difference between the two; never-the-less it is different.  Besides the tight harmonies and some musical decorations, their arrangement also changes the melody line slightly.

Shane Coffman's arrangement also has small changes to the words.  But nothing substantial.

### Recommendation

I recommend using the Shane Coffman arrangement with small modifications to melodically align with the Narrow Way arrangement.  I suspect that most people who are already familiar with this song know the slightly varying words; so I propose we use those instead of the original words.
