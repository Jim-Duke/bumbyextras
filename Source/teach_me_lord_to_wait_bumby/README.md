### Reason for the Submission

I don't recall when I first heard this song, but from the very first hearing I wanted to always be able to use the song in worship.  It is very singable and fits the text wonderfully.  In the original song, which was designed as a performance song to be sung by a single person, it was arranged to first sing the verses and conclude with the refrain.  But the refrain is so wonderful and uplifting to sing that I wanted to treat the refrain as a chorus and sing it after each verse.  That is yet another reason to add it to this hymnal: so that we can make that small modification.

### Original Verses

1. Teach me Lord, to wait down on my knees,  
   'Til in Your own good time You answer my pleas;  
   Teach me not to rely on what others do,  
   But to wait in prayer for an answer from You.

2. Teach me Lord, to wait while hearts are aflame,  
   Let me humble my pride and call on your name.  
   Keep my faith renewed, my eyes on Thee,  
   Let me be on this earth what you want me to be.

Refrain (After last stanza only):  

* "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength,  
  They shall mount up with wings like eagles.  
  They shall run and not be weary.  
  They shall walk and not faint."  
  Teach me Lord, teach me Lord, to wait.

### Variations in the text

I've only seen two variations of the text.

1. The first is that the word "right" or "while" before "knees" on the first verse.  That would render it as "Teach me Lord, to wait right down on my knees".  The appeal of this variation is that it fits the rhythm of the tune better.

2. The second variant is not an alteration of the text, but treating the refrain as a chorus and singing it at the conclusion of each verse.  So far as I know I'm the only one who has chosen to sing it that way.

### Tune

The Tune was not composed separately from the text.  They were always a single song.

The original song, however, was arranged for a single vocalist with instrumental accompaniment.  I found a good SATB Acapella arrangement by Gerald Moore.  The Moore arrangement didn't add any copyright and his estate has released all of his arrangements available free of charge.

### Researcher Recommendation

1. The song has a strong message drawn from Isaiah 40:31 and its musical setting wonderfully supports the message.
2. The song is not difficult and our congregation should have no difficulty singing it.
3. We should use the Gerald Moore SATB Acapella arrangement.
4. We should treat the refrain as a chorus.
5. Do not include extra words before "knees" on the first verse - holding to the original.

## Critical Review

I very much support the use of this song. I concur with using the word "right" in the first verse, as I also think it fits the rhythm better. Kashka and I both like singing the chorus twice. I am in full agreement. Greg

I am in full agreement with Jim's recommendations. Walcott
