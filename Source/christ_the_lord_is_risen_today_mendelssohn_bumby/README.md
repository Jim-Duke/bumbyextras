### Reason for the Submission

The hymn tune typically paired with Christ the Lord is Risen Today is relatively difficult to sing by many congregations.  On a whim, a group of us tried pairing the hymn with the tune used with Hark! the Herald Angels Sing.  The setting appealed greatly to us and we believe will be more accessible to the congregation.

### About the Hymn

Charles Wesley composed this "Hymn for Easter Day" in eleven stanzas. First sung at the famous Foundry Meeting House, the text was published in Hymns and Sacred Poems (1739). The "alleluia" responses, reflecting ancient Jewish and Christian practice, were added by later editors to fit the tune. Wesley's stanzas 1-2a and 3b-6 are included. 
The text contains some of the most familiar Easter themes: all creatures rejoice in Christ's resurrection (st. 1); the work of redemption is complete (st. 2); death is vanquished (st. 3); we have new life in Christ now (st. 4); we praise the victorious Christ (st. 5). The "alleluias," which remind us of the ancient Easter greeting, do more than interrupt the textual flow: they provide the framework for praising God with each line of text.

Liturgical Use
Easter Sunday morning; a great processional hymn.

Christ [our] the Lord, is risen today, Sons of men, &c. C. Wesley. [Easter.] This is one of the most popular and widely used of C. Wesley's hymns. It appeared in the Hymns and Sacred Poems, 1739, in 11 stanzas of 4 lines, with the heading "Hymn for Easter." In his Psalms and Hymns, 1760, No. 32, M. Madan introduced some alterations, and omitted stanzas vii.-ix., thereby forming a hymn of 8 stanzas. It is from this form of the hymn that all subsequent arrangements of the text have been made. It is curious that although it was in several collections of the Church of England in 1780, yet J. Wesley omitted it from the Wesleyan Hymn Book, which he compiled and published during that year, and it was not until the issue of the Supplement to that collection in 1830, that it appeared therein in any form, and then the alteration of stanza iv., 1. 3, "Dying once, He all doth save," to "Once He died our souls to save," was adopted from Madan. Its use is extensive in all English-speaking countries. The reading, "Christ, our Lord," &c, dates from Cotterill's Selection, 1810 (Poetical Works, 1868-72, vol. i. p. 185).

### Original Verses

1. Christ the Lord is ris'n To-day,  
   Sons of Men and Angels say,   
   Raise your Joys and Triumphs high,  
   Sing ye Heav'ns, and Earth reply.

2. Love's Redeeming Work is done,  
   Fought the Fight, the Battle won,  
   Lo! our Sun's Eclipse is o'er,  
   Lo! He sets in Blood no more.

3. Vain the Stone, the Watch, the Seal;  
   Christ hath burst the Gates of Hell!  
   Death in vain forbids his Rise:  
   Christ hath open'd Paradise!

4. Lives again our glorious King,  
   Where, O Death, is now thy Sting?  
   Once He died our Souls to save,  
   Where's thy Victory, O Grave?

5. Soar we now, where Christ hath led,  
   Following our Exalted Head,  
   Made like Him, like Him we rise:  
   Ours the Cross; the Grave; the Skies.

6. What tho' once we perish'd All,  
   Partners of our Parent's Fall,  
   Second Life we All receive,  
   In our Heav'nly *Adam* live.

7. Ris'n with Him, we upward move,  
   Still we seek the Things above,  
   Still pursue, and kiss the Son,  
   Seated on his Father's Throne;

8. Scarce on Earth a Thought bestow,  
   Dead to all we leave below,  
   Heav'n our Aim, and lov'd Abode,  
   Hid our Life with Christ in God!

9. Hid; 'till Christ our Life appear,  
   Glorious in his Members here:  
   Join'd to Him, we then shall shine  
   All Immortal, all Divine!

10. Hail the Lord of Earth and Heav'n!  
    Praise to Thee by both be giv'n:  
    Thee we greet Triumphant now;  
    Hail the Resurrection Thou!

11. King of Glory, Soul of Bliss!  
    Everlasting Life is This,  
    Thee to know, thy Pow'r to prove,  
    Thus to sing, and thus to love!

### Variations in the text

Most variations are in terms of which verses to include and sometimes in the ordering of the verses.  With the traditional pairing with EASTER HYMN alleluia's are added at the end of each phrase.  Of the original 11 stanzas, verses 1, 3, 4, and 5 are the most commonly used.

### Tune

The tune is from the second chorus of Felix Mendelssohn's Festgesang (Op. 68) for male voices and brass; it was first performed in 1840 at the Gutenberg Festival in Leipzig, a festival celebrating the anniversary of Gutenberg's invention of the printing press. Mendelssohn's tune is similar to another that appeared one hundred years earlier in 'The Song of Mars" from the John Pepusch opera Venus and Adonis.

Mendelssohn once wrote of this music, "It will never do to sacred words." William H. Cummings (b. Sidbury, Devonshire, England, 1831; d. Dulwich, London, England, 1915) may not have been aware of Mendelssohn’s opinion; he adapted the tune to Wesley's text in 1856. When they were placed together in Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861), "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" became a very popular hymn.

Cummings had a lifelong love of Felix Mendelssohn, sparked when he sang at age sixteen in the first London performance of Elijah, which was directed by Mendelssohn himself. As a young boy, Cummings had been a chorister at St. Paul's Cathedral and later sang in the choirs of the Temple Church, Westminster Abbey, and the Chapel Royal. Cummings became a famous tenor–he sang in oratorios and was especially known for his evangelist role in the Bach passions. He taught voice at the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal Normal College and School for the Blind in London and was also an accomplished organist. Cummings wrote books and articles on music history, wrote a biography of Henry Purcell and edited his music, and composed many choral pieces.

MENDELSSOHN is an excellent match for Wesley's text. It is a rousing tune, even martial in some of its phrases. Sing with lots of enthusiasm; do not drown out the stanzas with too much organ–save that extra stop for the refrain and the final stanza. Let the final stanza soar with the descant and the alternate harmonization by David Willcocks (b. Newquay, England, 1919), published in Carols for Choir 1(1961). Willcocks has had a highly distinguished musical career. A chorister at Westminster Abbey, he continued his education at Clifton College, the Royal College of Music, and King's College, Cambridge, England. He was organist of Worcester Cathedral (1950-1957) and conductor of the Bradford Festival Choral Society (1955-1974). Under his leader¬ship as director of music and organist of King's College, Cambridge, from 1957 to 1974, the King's College Choir began a series of recordings which, among other repertoires, made famous the annual Festival of Lessons and Carols. Beginning in 1960 Willcocks conducted the Bach Choir of London, and in 1973 he became director of the Royal College of Music. Mainly a composer of church music, Willcocks has also made arrangements of carols, many of which were published in the various Oxford's Carols for Choirs publications. He makes frequent trips to North America for choral festivals.

### Researcher Recommendation

Pairing "Christ the Lord is Risen Today" with the MENDELSSOHN requires that two of the original verses must be paired together and the alleluia's omitted to form a single verse in this setting.  In addition, the last two lines of the stanza that forms the 2nd half of one of these combined verses must be repeated.  Because of the nature of the music in the 2nd half of the tune, we strive to pair the grander of the two verses in the 2nd half.  Thus we propose the following 6 verses of the original 11 be paired thus:

1. First new verse made up of original verses 1 and 3; in that order.
2. Second new verse made up of original verses 4 and 5; in that order.
3. Third new verse made up of original verses 10 and 11; in reverse order.

When paired with the tune, the phrase "Where's thy Victory, O Grave?" requires the syllable breaks at: "Where's thy Vic -- to -- ry, O Grave?"; in typical 7 meter form, the emphasis is on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th syllables.  That means the emphasis is on: Where's; Vic; ry; and Grave?  We recommend that the line be rephrased slightly to be: "Where's they Vic'try Boasting Grave?"; with the syllables: "Where's; Vic; Boast; Grave"; which seems to work much better.

Thus the new verses will be rendered thus:

1. Christ the Lord is Ris'n Today  
   Sons of Men and Angels say,   
   Raise your Joys and Triumphs high,  
   Sing ye Heav'ns, and Earth reply.  
   Vain the Stone, the Watch, the Seal;  
   Christ hath burst the Gates of Hell!  
   Death in vain forbids his Rise:  
   Christ hath open'd Paradise!  
   Death in vain forbids his Rise:  
   Christ hath open'd Paradise!

2. Lives again our glorious King,  
   Where, O Death, is now thy Sting?  
   Once He died our Souls to save,  
   Where's thy Vict'ry, Boasting Grave?  
   Soar we now, where Christ hath led,  
   Following our Exalted Head,  
   Made like Him, like Him we rise:  
   Ours the Cross; the Grave; the Skies.  
   Made like Him, like Him we rise:  
   Ours the Cross; the Grave; the Skies.

3. King of Glory, Soul of Bliss!  
   Everlasting Life is This,  
   Thee to know, thy Pow'r to prove,  
   Thus to sing, and thus to love!  
   Hail the Lord of Earth and Heav'n!  
   Praise to Thee by both be giv'n:  
   Thee we greet Triumphant now;  
   Hail the Resurrection Thou!  
   Thee we greet Triumphant now;  
   Hail the Resurrection Thou!
