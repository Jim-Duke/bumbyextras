### Arrangements

I know of two arrangements for SATB: Shane Coffman's and Jesse Bartley's.  Shane Coffman's arrangement is more suitable for congregational use and Jesse Bartley's arrangement was obviously written for their TTBB acapella group.  However, there are aspects of both that are appealing.  I propose taking elements from both arrangements to create a new arrangement.

## Original Verses

When first written, the song originally had one verse followed by the refrain:

> Father God, just for today  
  help me walk Your narrow way.  
  Help me stand when I could fall.  
  Lend me the strength to hear Your call.

Refrain:  
> May my steps be worship  
  May my thoughts be praise.  
  May my words bring honor to Your name.  
  May my steps be worship  
  May my thoughts be praise.  
  May my words bring honor to Your name.

Later, Marc Schelske added a 2nd verse:

> Here I am, just for today  
  Live in me, have Your way.  
  For my desire, when this race is run  
  is only to hear You say “Well Done.”

### Variations

Narrow way's version is well suited to their TTBB acapella group.  They only sing the first verse and have tight harmonies suitable for a group such as theirs.  They modified the words slightly to suit the meter of their arrangement.  For example, they changed "help me walk Your narrow way" to "help me to walk Your narrow way".  Essentially the same words; but they added "to" to fit their slightly different meter.  There are other small changes in the words "Lend me the strength" is rendered "Give me the strength".  I don't see much of a difference between the two; never-the-less it is different.  Besides the tight harmonies and some musical decorations, their arrangement also changes the melody line slightly.  The Narrow Way arrangement also includes a descant in the chorus with one of the voices echoing the second phrase of the chorus "May my thoughts be praise".

Shane Coffman's arrangement also has small changes to the words.  But nothing substantial.  It also holds to the original arrangement fairly closely; including the variation in the rhythm between the first and second phrase of the verses.

The rhythms in the official version are more loosely sung; suitable to a solo singer.

### Recommendation

In listening to various versions posted to YouTube; particularly the one singing Shane Coffman's arrangement; I thought that we should simplify the arrangement.

I ended up making my own arrangement that simplified the song by removing the explicit decorations in some of the phrases and making various phrases more consistent.  The first and second verse are not rhythmically and melodically identical.  The chorus is compatible with the descant some people may know - but I eventually chose to not include the descant explicitly.  If people want to sing the descant; the music is arrange to allow that to work.  But I didn't encourage them to sing it by including the descant in the score.

I recommend we use the arrangement I settled on.
