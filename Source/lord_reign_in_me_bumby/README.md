### Hymn

See the Hymnary or Cyberhymnal entries to see the history of the hymn.

## Original Verses

See the YouTube video for the original verses.  This hymn was not originally intended for acapella congregational singing; and the original video reflects the structure of typical contemporary christian music.

### Recommendation

The original hymn was not written for acapella congregational singing and has a structure typical of contemporary christian songs performed by a band.  The acapella arrangement simplifies the structure into two verses and a chorus and adds SATB harmonization.  The basic style and message of the hymn was not modified.  The following is the result:

1. Over all the earth You reign on hign,  
   Ev'ry mountain stream ev'ry sunset sky,  
   But my one request Lord my only aim,  
   Is that you'd reign in me again!

2. Over ev'ry tho't over ev'ry word,   
   May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord,  
   'Cause you mean more to me than any earthly thing.  
   So won't you reign in me again!

Chorus:

    Lord reign in me, Reign in your power,  
    Over all my dreams, In my darkest hour,  
    You are the Lord of all I am,  
    So won't you reign in me again!  
    Won't you reign in me again!

I'm not a huge fan of adapting songs meant for a modern band to acapella congregational use.  However, among certain portions of our congregation it is greatly desired and so I won't object to it's use.
