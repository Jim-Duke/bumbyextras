### Reason for the Submission

The hymn tune typically paired with Christ the Lord is Risen Today is relatively difficult to sing by many congregations.  On a whim, a group of us tried pairing the hymn with the tune used with Hark! the Herald Angels Sing.  The setting appealed greatly to us and we believe will be more accessible to the congregation.

### Original Verses

1. Christ the Lord is ris'n to day,  
   Sons of Men and Angels say!  
   Raise your Joys and Triumphs high,  
   Sing, ye Heav'ns, and Earth, reply.

2. Love's redeeming Work is done,  
   Fought the Fight, the Battle won:  
   Lo! our Sun's Eclipse is o'er,  
   Lo! he sets in Blood no more.

3. Vain the Stone, the Watch, the Seal,  
   Christ hath burst the Gates of Hell:  
   Death in vain forbids his Rise,  
   Christ hath open'd Paradise.

4. Lives again our glorious King,  
   Where, O Death, is now thy Sting?  
   Once he dy'd our Souls to save;  
   Where's thy Victory, O Grave?"

5. Soar we now where Christ hath led,  
   Foll'wing our exalted Head;  
   Made like him, like him we rise,  
   Ours the Cross, the Grave, the Skies.

6. What tho' once we perish'd all,  
   Partners of our Parents Fall;  
   Second Life we all receive,  
   In our heav'nly Adam live.

7. Hail, the Lord of Earth and Heav'n!  
   Praise to thee by both be giv'n!  
   Thee we greet Triumphant now  
   Hail the Resurrection--thou!

8. King of Glory! Soul of bliss!  
   Everlasting Life is this--  
   Thee to know--thy Pow'r to prove,  
   Thus to sing, and thus to love.
