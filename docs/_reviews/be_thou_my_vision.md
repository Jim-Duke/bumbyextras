# Review Instructions

- Look for correct metadata (poet, translator, meter, poet, etc.)
- Listen to each practice MP3 to be sure it is correct for the part
- Look at the slides to be sure they would be easily readable when projected
- Any overall comments or suggestions
- Send an email to jim@dukeboys.org with any comments.  If you took the time to examine the hymn, please send me a note, even if you don't have any corrections or comments.
