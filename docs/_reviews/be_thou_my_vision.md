# Hymn Notes

I chose to restore all the original verses from the Eleanor Hull versification; but with some modifications.
See the wikipedia page for a side by side comparison of the original verses.  Eleanor Hull created two
different versificiations to different meters.  The one I chose is the most common one chosen.

However, after reading a sermon on the topic, I was convinced that the hymn was inspired by the verse in
Jeremiah - Jeremiah 9:23-24.  Because of that, I mixed the two variants of verse 3 by Eleanor Hull.

The two verses are as follows:

10.10.9.10 version:

Be Thou My Battle Shield, Sword for the fight;  
Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;  
Thou my soul's Shelter, Thou my high Tower:  
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.

10.11.11.11 version:

Be thou my Breastplate, my Sword for the fight;  
Be Thou my whole Armor, be Thou my Might;  
Be Thou my soul's Shelter, be Thou my strong Tow'r,
O raise Thou me heav'nward, great Power of my power.

In the Jeremiah verse states: "Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom, and let not the mighty man boast of his might,
let not a rich man boast of his riches."  These track verses 2, 3, and 4 which state that God is our of Wisdom,
Might, and Riches.  Because of the tune, I wanted the 10.10.9.10 version; but it doesn't reference Might; the 10.11.11.11
one does.  So I mixed the two so:

Be Thou my Battle Shield, Sword for the fight;  
Be Thou my whole Armor, be Thou my Might;  
Thou my soul's Shelter, Thou my high Tow'r:  
Raise Thou me heav'nward, O Power of my Power.

# TUNE

After comparing several arrangements of SLANE we settled on the one by C. E. Couchman.  That version can be found
in the hymnal Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs (PHASS).
