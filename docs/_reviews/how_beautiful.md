# Review Instructions
Review the next version of "How Beautiful" after all the recent changes.
This version should have improved upon all of the following:

* Improved layout.
  * Margins suitable for binding "inside" margin wider than the "outside" margin.
  * Combined parts - two voices on the same staff are printed as chords as opposed to separate stems, except when the parts differ or are identical, or near identical notes. (More conformant to standard hymnal styles)
  * Better shape note font - this is particularly true for half notes on ledger lines. The old font would have often make quarter notes indistinguishable from half notes when on a ledger line.
  * MUCH larger font and notes on slides
* MP3's run the full length of the hymn - all verses.
* MP3's use a different instrument for the dominant voice (Piano).
