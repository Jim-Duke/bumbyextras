# Review Instructions
Review the website.  Things to check for:
* Style - Does it have good style - is it appealing, consistent, functional
* Responsive - Does it work on a variety of devices (and screens)
* Bug free - Do all the links work?  Any weird renderings?
* Correct - Is everything where it should be?  The right files linked together.
