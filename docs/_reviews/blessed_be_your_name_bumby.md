  Look to the sources section for references to authoritative source.  Look to the typesetting notes for
  how the music and layout may have been modified.

# Typesetting Notes

## Original flow

Significant changes to the flow.  The original had a fairly complex flow.  The original had a flow as follows:

1. The verse section, repeated.  The two lines of each verse is sung before moving on to the next section.
   ("Blessed be your name in a land that is plentiful...")
2. A common short repeat with two parts to it.  ("Every blessing you pour out...")
3. A longer section that ends at a DC - so - go back to the beginning for the 2nd
   verse.  ("Blessed be the name of the Lord, Blessed be Your name ...")
4. When getting to the end of the longer section (#3 above), go to the coda
5. The CODA.  This starts with "You give and take away".  Then on to an overlapping section where the Men
   sing one thing, and the Women sing another.

Honestly, I haven't fully unraveled the intended flow; and I don't really intend to.  It is FAR too complex
as is for congregational singing.

## New flow and layout

1. I took the opening repeat and unrolled it - forming two verses.
2. I took the next repeated section ("Every blessing you pour out...") and unrolled it and made it the beginning
   of the "Refrain"
3. I kept the long section and put that after part #2 in the refrain.
4. I took the part where everyone sings "You give and take away" - and unrolled the repeat, and removed the
   instruction to omit the basses on the first pass.  That completes the new "Refrain"

The new version is now 2 pages, instead of the original 4.
