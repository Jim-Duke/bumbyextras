# Review Instructions

- Look for good layout - not cramped, well spaced notes, lyrics, and systems
- Look for correct metadata (poet, translator, meter, poet, etc.)
- Listen to each practice MP3 to be sure it is correct for the part

- Any overall comments or suggestions
- Be sure to look at the research which provide sources for the original verses

# HYMN

See the research page for an analysis of the various published variants.  The version recommended
is the one in the English Hymns (1906).  See the research page for sources.

# TUNE

See the research page for an analysis of the Tune.  This is without controversy since the tune
and its arrangement have been fairly stable.
