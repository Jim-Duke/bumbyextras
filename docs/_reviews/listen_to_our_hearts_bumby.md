# Review Instructions

- Check for spelling errors
- Look for good layout - not cramped, well spaced notes, lyrics, and systems
- Look for correct metadata (poet, translator, meter, poet, etc.)
- Listen to each practice MP3 to be sure it is correct for the part
- Look at the slides to be sure they would be easily readable when projected
- Any overall comments or suggestions
- This hymn was particularly challenging to typeset; with many special cases.
  please be sure to carefully examine all the music and MP3's for subtle diffences.
- Be sure to look at the research which provide sources for the original verses
