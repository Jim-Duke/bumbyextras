# Review Instructions

- Check for spelling errors
- Look for good layout - not cramped, well spaced notes, lyrics, and systems
- Look for correct metadata (poet, translator, meter, poet, etc.)
- Listen to each practice MP3 to be sure it is correct for the part
- Look at the slides to be sure they would be easily readable when projected
- Any overall comments or suggestions
- Be sure to look at the research which provide sources for the original verses
- There are two versions of All Glory Laud and Honor that are available: A and B.  The only difference is the
  arrangement.  During your review, please let me know which of the two arrangements you prefer.
