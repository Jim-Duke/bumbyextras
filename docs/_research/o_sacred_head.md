# HYMN

The short history of this hymn is as follows.  A medieval poet wrote an extensive poem that had seven cantos
addressing 7 areas of the crucified body.  The poem was long attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux (1091-1153),
but recent scholarship seems has attributed the work to Arnulf of Leuven (died 1250).  The original work was
in latin.

The poem was translated into German by the Lutheran hymnist Paul Gerhardt (1607-1676).  It was during this
time that the last cantos about Christ's head began to be favored as a separate hymn.

The German version was then translated into English first by John Gambold in 1752.  But the most commonly
used translation was made by James Waddel Alexander in 1830.

Alexander's version is in 10 stanzas.  The most typical setting uses the first half of stanza 1 with the second
half of stanza 2 for one verse; and then stanza 8 for the second verse.  But the selected verses vary widely
in modern hymnals.

## Original Verses of Alexander's Translation

Taken from [Alexander's Translation on the Gutenberg.org project](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43206/43206-h/43206-h.htm).

1.  O sacred head! now wounded,  
    With grief and shame weighed down,  
    Now scornfully surrounded  
    With thorns, thy only crown;  
    O sacred Head! what glory,  
    What bliss, till now was thine!  
    Yet, though despised and gory,  
    I joy to call thee mine.  

2.  O noblest brow, and dearest!  
    In other days the world  
    All feared, when thou appeared’st,  
    What shame on thee is hurled!  
    How art thou pale with anguish,  
    With sore abuse and scorn;  
    How does that visage languish,  
    Which once was bright as morn.  

3.  The blushes late residing  
    Upon that holy cheek,  
    The roses once abiding  
    Upon those lips so meek,  
    Alas! they have departed;  
    Wan Death has rifled all!  
    For weak and broken-hearted,  
    I see thy body fall.  

4.  What thou, my Lord, hast suffered,  
    Was all for sinners’ gain:  
    Mine, mine was the transgression,  
    But thine the deadly pain.  
    Lo! here I fall, my Saviour,  
    ’Tis I deserve thy place;  
    Look on me with thy favor,  
    Vouchsafe to me thy grace.  

5.  Receive me, my Redeemer,  
    My Shepherd, make me thine;  
    Of every good the fountain,  
    Thou art the spring of mine.  
    Thy lips with love distilling,  
    And milk of truth sincere,  
    With heaven’s bliss are filling  
    The soul that trembles here.  

6.  Beside thee, Lord, I’ve taken  
    My place—forbid me not!  
    Hence will I ne’er be shaken,  
    Though thou to death be brought.  
    If pain’s last paleness hold thee,  
    In agony opprest,  
    Then, then will I enfold thee  
    Within this arm and breast!  

7.  The joy can ne’er be spoken,   
    Above all joys beside.   
    When in thy body broken  
    I thus with safety hide.  
    My Lord of life, desiring  
    Thy glory now to see.  
    Beside the cross expiring,  
    I’d breathe my soul to thee.  

8.  What language shall I borrow  
    To thank thee, dearest Friend,  
    For this, thy dying sorrow,  
    Thy pity without end?  
    Oh! make me thine forever,  
    And should I fainting be,  
    Lord let me never, never  
    Outlive my love to thee.  

9.  And when I am departing,  
    Oh! part not thou from me;  
    When mortal pangs are darting,  
    Come, Lord, and set me free;  
    And when my heart must languish  
    Amidst the final throe,  
    Release me from mine anguish  
    By thine own pain and wo!  

10. Be near me when I am dying,  
    Oh! show thy cross to me;  
    And for my succor flying,  
    Come, Lord, and set me free!  
    These eyes new faith receiving.  
    From Jesus shall not move,  
    For he who dies believing,  
    Dies safely through thy love.  

# TUNE

The music for the German and English versions is by Hans Leo Hassler written around 1600 for the secular
love song "Mein G'mut is mir verwirret".  It was simplified when paired with Gerhardt's version of the
hymn.  Johann Sebastian Bach arranged the melody and used five stanzas of the hymn in four different
settings in his St Matthew Passion as well as in many other of his works.  Bach's arrangement is almost
universally used today.
