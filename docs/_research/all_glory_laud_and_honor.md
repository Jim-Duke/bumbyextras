### Hymn

Copied from the Hymnary entry - which in turn copied it from Psalter Hymnal Handbook

Scripture References: st. 1-3 = Matt. 21:1-17, Mark 11:1-10, Luke 19:28-38, John 12:12-13 st. 2 = Rev. 5:11-12

Theodulph, bishop of Orleans, wrote this text around 820 while he was imprisoned at Angers, France, for conspiring
against King Louis the Pious. A probably apocryphal story from the early sixteenth century states that in a Palm
Sunday procession King Louis passed the prison in which Theodulph was housed and heard the imprisoned bishop singing
this hymn. According to the legend the king was so moved that he freed Theodulph and decreed the singing of
"All Glory, Laud, and Honor" on all subsequent Palm Sundays. The text was originally in thirty-nine Latin couplets,
although only the first twelve lines were sung in ancient liturgical use (since a late-ninth-century manuscript from
St. Gall). John M. Neale (PHH 342) translated the text into English in his Medieval Hymns and Sequences (1851). Neale
revised that translation for The Hymnal Noted (1854); a further altered text was included in the original edition of
Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861). Based on Matthew 21:1-11 (and similar passages in Mark 11, Luke 19, and John 12),
the text was originally written for a Palm Sunday procession. Thus it reflects on the original Palm Sunday's hymns
of praise by the Jews as well as on our praise today. Liturgical Use: Palm Sunday morning processional; possibly
during Advent. --Psalter Hymnal Handbook

## Original Verses


### Tune

The tune that is almost universally paired with Be Thou My Vision is SLANE.  There are several arrangements.

### Recommendation

Many hymnals omit verse 3 - and many more make slide modifications to the words.  I find all 5 verses appealing
and want to keep them all.

There are two ways that hymnals arrange the verses.  In the first, and I believe the first form, has the "All Glory,
laud, and honor..." as a Refrain that is repeated at the beginning of every verse; making 5 verses with refrain.  The
other way is to take the refrain, and each of the five verses and pair them off into 3 verses.  Both have appeal.
I suggest supporting both versions.
