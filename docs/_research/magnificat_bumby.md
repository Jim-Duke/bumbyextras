# {{ page.title }}
Magnificat by Randy Gill is a popular hymn similar to The Greatest Command in that it is setup where each voice part sings a different tune and words; and it starts with one part and builds adding one part a round; until all the parts are singing their individual parts and words together.  The words are drawn from the Magnificat - the prayer of Mary as recorded in Luke 1:46-55; specifically verses 1:46-50.

I do not know of any variations of this song.

### Researcher Recommendation

This song is popular among the summer camp group, in particular.  It's fun to sing and is rooted in scripture.  It doesn't have a great deal of depth; but is still acceptable for use in worship.  I recommend that we include this song in our hymnal and use it exactly as written.
