### Hymn

Poet: Walter Chalmers Smith
Date Originally Published: 1867 in "Hymns of Christ and the Christian Life"

See the Hymnary or Cyberhymnal entries to see a more in-depth history of the hymn.

## Verses

The hymn underwent many modifications over the years, by the author as well as by other hymnal editors.  The original 6 stanzas
were never used except in the original publication.  W.C. Smith revised it in several later publications.  The one in
"Worship Songs" is the best example.  Sometimes attribution is given to Horder, the editor of the hymnal, but evidence
suggests that Smith did the revision.  The version published in the influential "English Hymns" of 1906 appears to have been
modified by the editors of that hymnal.  That version is the one most commonly used in the original.

### TUNE

Name: ST. DENIO
Composer: Traditional Welsh Ballad

### Copyright

Both the hymn and the tune are in the public domain.

### Recommendation

In examining the various versions I prefer the English Hymns revision.  I think it is faithful to the original but is actually
easier to both sing and understand.
