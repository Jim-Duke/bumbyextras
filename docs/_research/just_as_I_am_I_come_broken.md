### Hymn

I don't have an historical background for this hymn.

### Original Verses

This variant of Just As I Am uses the first two verses from the original hymn; but adds the "I Come Broken" refrain and a new third verse.

1. Just as I am without one plea  
   but that Thy blood was shed for me,  
   And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,  
   O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

2. Just as I am and waiting not  
   to rid my soul of one dark blot.  
   To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,  
   O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

3. Just as I am I would be lost,  
   but mercy and grace my freedom bought.  
   And now to glory in Your cross,  
   O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

**Refrain:**  
I come broken to be mended,  
I come wounded to be healed.  
I come desp'rate to be rescued.  
I come empty to be filled.  
I come guilty to be pardoned  
by the blood of Christ, the Lamb,  
and I'm welcomed with open arms,  
Praise God, just as I am.

**CODA:**  
Praise God, just as I am.

### Researcher Recommendation

The words of the original hymn, of course, are wonderful.  The new words are an appropriate reaction to the thoughts contained in the original hymn.  While I am not personally attracted to songs of this nature, I recognize that a great many people are and the thoughts contained in this hymn are good and appropriate for worship.

The original arrangement had a somewhat complex flow; with 2 verses of the original being sung; then the new refrain; then the new 3rd verse; then the new refrain twice; followed by the Coda.  I propose that we simplify the flow and treat the new refrain as a chorus that is performed after each verse.  The Coda can be included; should be optional.

There are other arrangements, but they are all more musically difficult.  I didn't even seek to obtain copies of them.  The Souder arrangement is very approachable - although the new refrain has some very modern chords that will prove to be a challenge to some.  Compared to all other arrangements, however, it is by far the easiest to sing.
