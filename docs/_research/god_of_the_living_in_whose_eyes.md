# Hymn

God of the living, in Whose eye. J. Ellerton. [Burial.] Written for and first published in his Hymns for Schools
and Bible Classes (Brighton), 1858, in 3 stanzas of 4 lines. On July 6, 1867, it was expanded by the author into
5 stanzas of 6 lines, and in this form was published in the Brown-Borthwick Words of the Supplemental Hymn and
Tune Book, n.d. : and the Select Hymns for Church & Home, 1871. Also in the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge Church Hymns, 1871, No. 245. It is in somewhat extensive use, the longer form being that usually adopted.
The two forms are in Dr. Martineau's Hymns of Praise and Prayer, 1873, as Nos. 511 and 797.
--John Julian, Dictionary of Hymnology (1907)

Given the above mention of an original version in 3 stanzas of 4 lines.  I was not able to find any copy of those
words anywhere.  The version with 6 line stanzas is all I could find.  Some hymnals omitted some of the 5 verses;
but clearly they were drawn from the 2nd expanded version from 1867.

There is little variation in the rendering of the words in all the hymnals I examined.

# Tune

There are many tunes this hymn has been set to.  But I prefer the one recently composed by C. E. Couchman

The hymn is in the public domain.
The tune is copyright 2011 by C. E. Couchman

# Doctrine

The hymn is immensely rich in sprititual content, and addresses a topic with few hymns available.

# Recommendations

I highly recommend using this hymn with the standard 5 verse words and tune by C. E. Couchman
