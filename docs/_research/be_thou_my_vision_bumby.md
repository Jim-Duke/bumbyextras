### Hymn

See the above sources - and there are a great many more.  This is a much talked about hymn.

## Original Verses

This gets tricky.  The original is in ancient Irish.  This was in turn translated into English by Mary Byrne in 1905.  This English version was then versified (adjusted to fit a standard meter appropriate for singing) by Eleanor Hull in 1912.  Eleanor created two versions that fit to different meters.  The verses shown here are the ones that best fit the most common tune SLANE using the 10.10.9.10 meter.

These are the original verses that were versified by Eleanor Hull.

1. Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;  
   Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.  
   Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,  
   Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light. 

2. Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;  
   I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;  
   Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;  
   Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

3. Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;  
   Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;  
   Thou my soul’s Shelter, Thou my high Tower:  
   Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.

4. Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,  
   Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:  
   Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,  
   High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.  

5. High King of Heaven, my victory won,  
   May I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heaven’s Sun!  
   Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,  
   Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

### Tune

The tune that is almost universally paired with Be Thou My Vision is SLANE.  There are several arrangements.

### Recommendation

Many hymnals omit verse 3 - and many more make slide modifications to the words.  I find all 5 verses appealing and want to
keep them all.  We will hold to the original words by Eleanor Hull.

For the arrangement, several have reviewed the available arrangements and settled on the one by C. E. Couchman.  She has
granted us permission to use the arrangements under the terms that appropriate credit is given to her, and that she owns
the copyright to the arrangement.
