### Reason for the Submission

After becoming aware of the additional verses of the original Hymn and how meaningful some of them are, Tim felt that adding two additional verses from the original would greatly enhance the hymn in our worship.

### Research Conducted By

Jim Duke

### Hymn

## Original Verses

I was not able to locate an authoritative source of the original verses.  The earliest copy of the hymn that I was able to find containing all 8 verses is from the [1880 Evangelical Lutheran Hymnal]({{ "/assets/abide_with_me/AllVersesFrom1880Hymnal.pdf" | relative_url }})).  The following text, including punctuation, spelling, and capitalization is copied here:

1. Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;  
   The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!  
   When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,  
   Help of the helpless, O abide with me!

2. Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;   
   Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;  
   Change and decay in all around I see.  
   O Thou who changes not, abide with me!

3. Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word,  
   But as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord,  
   Familiar, condescending, patient, free,  
   Come, not to sojourn, but abide with me.

4. Come not in terrors as the King of kings,  
   But kind and good, with healing on Thy wings;  
   Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea;  
   O Friend of sinners, thus abide with me!

5. Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,  
   And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,  
   Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee:  
   On to the close, O Lord, abide with me! 

6. I need Thy presence every passing hour:  
   What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power?  
   Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?  
   Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!

7. I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:  
   Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.  
   Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?  
   I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!

8. Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes,  
   Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies:  
   Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;  
   In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!

### Recommendation

Hymns for Worship (R. J. Stevens) includes verses 1, 2, and 6 of the original.  Songs, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs (Sumphonia) includes verses 1, 2, 4, and 6 in the music; and 7 and 8 as additional verses.

6 Verses fit nicely into the music on a single page.  I recommend that we include verses 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 in the version we put together.  I furthermore recommend that we retain the archaic language, capitalize in poetic forms, and punctuate as in the 1880 Evangelical Lutheran Hymnal.  The resulting hymn verses would then be:

1. Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;  
   The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!  
   When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,  
   Help of the helpless, O abide with me!

2. Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;   
   Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;  
   Change and decay in all around I see.  
   O Thou who changes not, abide with me!

3. Come not in terrors as the King of kings,  
   But kind and good, with healing on Thy wings;  
   Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea;  
   O Friend of sinners, thus abide with me!

4. I need Thy presence every passing hour:  
   What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power?  
   Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?  
   Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!

5. I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:  
   Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.  
   Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?  
   I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!

6. Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes,  
   Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies:  
   Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;  
   In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!
