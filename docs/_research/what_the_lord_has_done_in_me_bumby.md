## Hymn

Reuban Morgan

Adapted to be more suitable for congregational acapella singing.

## Tune

Reuban Morgan

Not sure who arranged the acapella version - perhaps Hillsong itself.  But I haven't seen attribution.

### Recommendation

Use the version used by Sumphonia.  The original verses were ever so slightly different - they had an
even more irregular rhythm.  The adapted version is still fairly irregular; but it's not as bad; and it
doesn't change the meaning at all.
