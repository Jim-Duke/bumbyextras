lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "Immortal, invisible, God only wise,"
    - "In light inaccessible hid from our eyes;"
    - "Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,"
    - "Almighty, victorious, thy great name we praise."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,"
    - "Nor wanting, nor wasting, thou rulest in might;"
    - "Thy justice like mountains high soaring above"
    - "Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love."
  - name: "Verse 3"
    lines:
    - "To all life thou givest, to both great and small;"
    - "In all life thou livest, the true life of all;"
    - "We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,"
    - "And wither and perish, but nought changeth thee."
  - name: "Verse 4"
    lines:
    - "Great Father of Glory, pure Father of Light,"
    - "Thine Angels adore thee, all veiling their sight;"
    - "All laud we would render: O help us to see"
    - "'Tis only the splendour of light hideth thee."
