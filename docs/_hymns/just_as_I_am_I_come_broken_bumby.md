lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "Just as I am without one plea"
    - "but that Thy blood was shed for me,"
    - "And that Thou bidst me come to Thee"
    - "O Lamb of God, I come, I Come."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "Just as I am and waiting not"
    - "to rid my soul of one dark blot."
    - "To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,"
    - "O Lamb of God, I come, I Come."
  - name: "Verse 3"
    lines:
    - "Just as I am I would be lost,"
    - "but mercy and grace my freedom bought."
    - "And now to glory in Your cross,"
    - "O Lamb of God, I come, I Come."
  - name: "Chorus"
    lines:
    - "I come broken to be mended."
    - "I come wounded to be healed."
    - "I come desp'rate to be rescued."
    - "I come empty to be filled."
    - "I come guilty to be pardoned"
    - "by the blood of Christ the Lamb,"
    - "and I'm welcomed with open arms,"
    - "praise God, just as I am."
