notes: "Henry Francis Lyte is said to have written this hymn after he had contracted tuberculosis.
 It was during this time of decline that he wrote this hymn.  Each line of the hymn ends with
 an appeal for God to \"Abide with me\".  Many hymnals mistakenly categorize this hymn with
 evening hymns.  While the hymn references the close of a day - the figure is referring to the
 end of life.  As life dims, as the body fails, as joys diminish - the yearning for the presence
 of God increases."
