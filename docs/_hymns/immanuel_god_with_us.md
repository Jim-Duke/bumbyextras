lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "God incarnate, can it be?"
    - "Ponder now the mystery:"
    - "He, the fount of eternal life,"
    - "Must drink the cup of mortality."
    - "Immanuel, God with us."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "Shepherds wonder at the scene:"
    - "Swaddling robes for deity;"
    - "Heaven's throne now a bed of straw"
    - "Within these borrowed stable walls."
    - "Immanuel, God with us."
  - name: "Verse 3"
    lines:
    - "God Creator, now created,"
    - "Lord of all in infancy,"
    - "Hands that lighted the evening stars"
    - "Reach out for comfort in Mary's arms."
    - "Immanuel, God with us."
    - "Our God with us."
