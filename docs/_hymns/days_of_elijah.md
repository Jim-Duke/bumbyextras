lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "These are the days of Elijah"
    - "declaring the Word of the Lord;"
    - "And these are the days of Your servant Moses,"
    - "righteousness being restored,"
    - "And tho' these are days of great trials,"
    - "of famine and darkness and sword;"
    - "Still we are the voice in the desert crying,"
    - "\"Prepare ye the way of the Lord.\""
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "And These are the days of Ezekiel,"
    - "the dry bones becoming as flesh;"
    - "And these are the days of Your servant David,"
    - "rebuilding a temple of praise."
    - "And these are the days of the harvest,"
    - "the fields are as white in Your world,"
    - "and we are the laborers in Your vinyard"
    - "declaring the Word of the Lord."
  - name: "Chorus"
    lines:
    - "Behold, He comes riding on the clouds,"
    - "shining like the sun at the trumpet call."
    - "So lift your voice, it's the year of Jubilee,"
    - "and out of Zion's Hill salvation comes."
  - name: "Never ending coda"
    lines:
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "There's no God like Jehovah"
    - "Behold, He comes riding on the clouds,"
    - "shining like the sun at the trumpet call."
    - "So lift your voice, it's the year of Jubilee,"
    - "and out of Zion's Hill salvation comes."
    - "Who was and Who is and Who is to come!"
    - "Who was and Who is and Who is to come!"
