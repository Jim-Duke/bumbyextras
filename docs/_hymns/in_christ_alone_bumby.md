lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "In Christ alone my hope is found;"
    - "He is my light, my strength, my song;"
    - "This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,"
    - "Firm through the fiercest drought and storm."
    - "What heights of love, what depths of peach,"
    - "When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!"
    - "My Comforter, my All in All,"
    - "Here in the love of Christ I stand."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "In Christ alone! who took on flesh,"
    - "Fullness of God in helpless babe."
    - "This gift of love and righteousness,"
    - "Scorned by the ones He came to save."
    - "Till on that cross as Jesus died,"
    - "The wrath of God was satisfied;"
    - "For every sin on Him was laid;"
    - "Here in the death of Christ I live."
  - name: "Verse 3"
    lines:
    - "There in the ground His body lay,"
    - "Light of the world by darkness slain;"
    - "Then bursting forth in glorious day,"
    - "Up from the grave He rose again!"
    - "And as He stands in victory,"
    - "Sin's curse has lost its grip on me;"
    - "For I am His and He is mine,"
    - "Bought with the precious blood of Christ."
  - name: "Verse 4"
    lines:
    - "No guilt in life, nor fear in death,"
    - "This is the pow'r of Christ in me;"
    - "From life's first cry to final breath,"
    - "Jesus commands my destiny."
    - "No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,"
    - "Can ever pluck me from His hand;"
    - "Till He returns or calls me home,"
    - "Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand."
