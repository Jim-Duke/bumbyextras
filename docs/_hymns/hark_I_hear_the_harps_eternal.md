  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "Hark! I hear the harps eternal, Ringing on the farther shore,"
    - "As I near those swollen waters, With their deep and solemn roar."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "And my soul, tho' stained with sorrow, Fading as the light of day,"
    - "Passes swiftly o'er those waters, To the city far away."
  - name: "Verse 3"

    - "Souls have crossed before me, saintly, To that land of perfect rest;"
    - "And I hear them singing faintly, In the mansions of the blest."

    - "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Halleluja! Praise the Lamb!"
    - "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Glory to the great I AM!"
