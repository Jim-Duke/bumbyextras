lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "Blessed be your name"
    - "In a land that is plentiful"
    - "Where your streams of abundance flow,"
    - "Blessed be your name."
    - "Blessed be your name"
    - "When I'm found in the desert place"
    - "Though I walk through the wilderness,"
    - "Blessed be your name."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "Blessed be your name"
    - "when the sun's shining down on me"
    - "When the world's \"all as it should be,\""
    - "Blessed be your name."
    - "Blessed be your name"
    - "On a road marked with suffering"
    - "Though there's pain in the offering,"
    - "Blessed be your name."
  - name: "Refrain"
    lines:
    - "Ev'ry blessing you pour out I"
    - "turn back to praise."
    - "When the darkness closes in Lord,"
    - "still I will say,"
    - "Blessed be the name of the Lord,"
    - "Blessed be Your name."
    - "Blessed be the name of the Lord,"
    - "Blessed be your glorious name."
    - "You give and take away,"
    - "You give and take away,"
    - "My heart will choose to say,"
    - "\"Lord, blessed be Your name.\""
