lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "Weeping garden, gently bow your leaves."
    - "Wilt beside the Savior as He grieves."
    - "Turn away the spendor of each flow'r."
    - "Hush the birds in this, His desp'rate hour."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "Weeping garden, look upon his face."
    - "See his anguish, tempered by such grace."
    - "As He suffers, sweat pours out as blood."
    - "Let your sorrow drip from ev'ry bud."
  - name: "Verse 3"
    lines:
    - "Weeping garden, how the twilight dims,"
    - "Through your canopy of twisted limbs."
    - "Traitors lurking near the garden's bliss,"
    - "Whisper of a cold betrayal kiss."
  - name: "Verse 4"
    lines:
    - "Weeping garden, hear the pray'r He speaks"
    - "Not His will, but God's He humbly seeks."
    - "Greater love has never been displayed."
    - "Weep with Him who weeps beneath your shade!"
