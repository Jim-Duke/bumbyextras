lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "O sacred head! now wounded,"
    - "With grief and shame weighed down,"
    - "Now scornfully surrounded"
    - "With thorns, thy only crown;"
    - "O sacred Head! what glory,"
    - "What bliss, till now was thine!"
    - "Yet, though despised and gory,"
    - "I joy to call thee mine."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "O noblest brow, and dearest!"
    - "In other days the world"
    - "All feared, when thou appeared’st,"
    - "What shame on thee is hurled!"
    - "How art thou pale with anguish,"
    - "With sore abuse and scorn;"
    - "How does that visage languish,"
    - "Which once was bright as morn."
  - name: "Verse 3"
    lines:
    - "What thou, my Lord, hast suffered,"
    - "Was all for sinners’ gain:"
    - "Mine, mine was the transgression,"
    - "But thine the deadly pain."
    - "Lo! here I fall, my Saviour,"
    - "’Tis I deserve thy place;"
    - "Look on me with thy favor,"
    - "Vouchsafe to me thy grace."
  - name: "Verse 4"
    lines:
    - "What language shall I borrow"
    - "To thank thee, dearest Friend,"
    - "For this, thy dying sorrow,"
    - "Thy pity without end?"
    - "Oh! make me thine forever,"
    - "And should I fainting be,"
    - "Lord let me never, never"
    - "Outlive my love to thee."
  - name: "Verse 5"
    lines:
    - "Be near me when I am dying,"
    - "Oh! show thy cross to me;"
    - "And for my succor flying,"
    - "Come, Lord, and set me free!"
    - "These eyes new faith receiving."
    - "From Jesus shall not move,"
    - "For he who dies believing,"
    - "Dies safely through thy love."
