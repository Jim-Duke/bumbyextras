According to an edition of the British Weekly, in the late summer of 1847, after preaching his final sermon, knowing
his time on earth was drawing to a close, Henry Francis Lyte "walked in the valley garden in front of the home, then
down to the rocks, where he sat and composed. It was a lovely sunny day and the sun was setting over distant Dartmoor
in a blaze of glory. On the left lay Brixham harbor like a pool of molten gold, with its picturesque trawling vessels
lying peacefully at anchor. After the sun had set, Lyte returned to his study. His family thought he was resting, but
he was putting the finishing touches to his immortal hymn" (Bailey, The Gospel in Hymns, 171). Later that fall, Lyte
passed away, but his hymn has indeed endured through the years as a beloved hymn of peace and prayer in the face of
change. Theodore L. Cuyler once relayed a story in which a dying woman recited this hymn as she lay in bed during her
last hours. He writes, "As I came away from that room, which had been as the vestibule of heaven, I understood how the
'light of eventide' could be only a flashing forth of the overwhelming glory that plays for ever around the throne of
God" (Sankey, My Life and Sacred Songs, 57). What a beautiful image when we see the light of day ebbing - this light
is only a shadow of the light of life that shines forth from Christ.

## Text
This text, written by Henry F. Lyte near the end of his life, was inspired by Luke 24:29, in which the travelers to
Emmaus tell Jesus, "stay with us, for it is nearly evening."  Many hymnals have in the past mistakenly placed this hymn
in a section of hymns meant to be sung in the evening. However, though the text refers to the darkening hour,
"evening" is a metaphor for the close of one's life, not a reference to the ending of the day. Most modern hymnals omit
three of the original eight stanzas.

## Tune
Some sources claim that William H. Monk wrote his tune, EVENTIDE, in just ten minutes at a committee meeting for the
1861 edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern. Lyte's text had no tune, so Monk sat down at the piano and wrote one.
Others claim that he wrote the tune during a time of great sorrow, while watching the sun set.

Paul Westermeyer considers EVENTIDE to be Monk's most characteristic tune - that is, "never vulgar, never extravagant,
often distractingly dull," and bordering on the sentimental. It can have this tendency, especially when taken too slow.
Even though it's a tune for generally solemn occasions, be sure it doesn't drag.

## About This Version
Our main hymnal - Hymns for Worship (revised) - like most other hymnals already contains Abide With Me.  Unfortunately
it only contains 3 of the original 8 verses - verses 1, 2, and 6 from the original.  This version contains 3 additional
verses from the original for a total of 6 verses: verses 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 from the original.

## Original Verses

1. Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;  
   The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!  
   When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,  
   Help of the helpless, O abide with me!

2. Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;   
   Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;  
   Change and decay in all around I see.  
   O Thou who changes not, abide with me!

3. Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word,  
   But as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord,  
   Familiar, condescending, patient, free,  
   Come, not to sojourn, but abide with me.

4. Come not in terrors as the King of kings,  
   But kind and good, with healing on Thy wings;  
   Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea;  
   O Friend of sinners, thus abide with me!

5. Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,  
   And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,  
   Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee:  
   On to the close, O Lord, abide with me! 

6. I need Thy presence every passing hour:  
   What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power?  
   Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?  
   Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!

7. I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:  
   Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.  
   Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?  
   I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!

8. Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes,  
   Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies:  
   Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;  
   In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!
