lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "How do you explain,"
    - "how do you describe"
    - "A love that goes from east to west,"
    - "and runs as deep as it is wide."
    - "You know all our hopes,"
    - "Lord, You know all our fears,"
    - "And words cannot express the love we feel"
    - "but we long for You to hear."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "If words could fall like rain"
    - "from these lips of mine,"
    - "And if I had a thou -- sand years,"
    - "Lord, I would still run out of time."
    - "If you listen to my heart,"
    - "ev'ry beat will say:"
    - "\"Thank You for the Life,"
    - "Thank You for the Truth,"
    - "Thank You for the Way.\""
  - name: "Refrain"
    lines:
    - "So listen to our hearts, (O Lord, please listen)"
    - "hear our spirits sing (and hear us sing)"
    - "A song of praise that flows (a simple song of praise)"
    - "from those You have redeemed. (from those You have redeemed)"
    - "We will use the words we know"
    - "to tell You what an awesome God You are."
    - "But words are not enough"
    - "to tell You of our love,"
    - "so listen to our hearts."
