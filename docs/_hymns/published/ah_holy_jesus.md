Ah Holy Jesus is an English translation of a 17th century German hymn that is in turn based upon an 11th century Latin
work.  It is a beautiful and poignant statement of the suffering and death of Jesus as a result of our own sin; and our
response to such a gift.

## Text
Johann Heerman took his inspiration for "Ah, Holy Jesus" from a Latin text originally attributed to Augustine (354-430).
Recent scholarship attributes the text to Jean de Fecamp (c.1000-1079). The poetry was originally published in a
fifteenth-century devotional book entitled Meditationes Divi Augustini. Heerman's hymn version first appeared in his
Devoti Musica Cordis, ca. 1630.

Heerman wrote during the Thirty Years War, a time when many hymn writers became introspective. Writing during this time
of uncertainty and trouble, Heerman's hymn emerged from a backdrop of his own personal suffering. In the lyrics,
Heerman describes the afflictions of Jesus, and admits his own part in Jesus' death.

## Translation
For the English translation, there are two main sources: the one translated by Catherine Winkworth - often referred to
as "O dearest Jesus", and the one translated by Robert Bridges - often referred to as "Ah, Holy Jesus".  The Winkworth
version is directly translated from the German.  The Bridges version instead chose to not produce a direct
translation - which would have created English text that didn't fit the meter of the music.  Instead, Bridges chose to
pull from both the original Latin and the German and produce an English version that captures the thoughts in the
originals; but also follows the music's meter.  It is a masterful creation.  We use the Bridges version of the text as
the basis for our text.

It's interesting to note that Robert Bridges first published Ah, Holy Jesus in his "Yattendon Hymnal" in 1899.  The
purpose of that hymnal was for musical reasons.  He wanted to introduce better musical settings to the hymns in use
at the time.  He explains in the preface to the historical notes:

> The origin of this book was my attempt, when precentor of a village choir, to provide better settings of the hymns
> than those in use. When I gave up my office, I printed the first twenty-five hymns for the convenience of the choir,
> and also for the sake of the tunes by Jeremy Clark, which I had been at some pains to restore, and for the
> preservation of the tunes composed on our behalf by Professor Wooldridge.

In effect, Bridges was engaged in an effort to construct a hymnal in the reverse process than normally used: he tried
to find good hymn tunes to restore to use; rather than find hymn texts as a primary object.  The result of that is that
he found many good tunes that had no texts associated with them; largely due to the fact that they did not follow common
meters used in Englishy hymnody.  Rather than modify the tunes to fit the meter of some text, he instead drew upon
a vaiety of sources to revise the text to fit the meter of the tune.  As he explains in the preface to the Yattendon
Hymnal:

> Among the old melodies which it is the chief object of this book to restore to use, some will be found which will be
> quite new to the public, while others will be familiar though in a somewhat different form; and since the sources
> whence all the tunes are taken are well known, and have been already largely drawn upon by the compilers of Psalters
> and hymnals, any melody which is new in this book may be considered as having been hitherto overlooked or rejected,
> while in the alternative case it is to be understood that the original cast of the melody has at some former time
> been altered, (frequently to suit the English common metre to which it was not at first comfortable,) and is now
> restored.

One of the best results of this process is his tranlsation of Ah, Holy Jesus.  In the case of that text, Bridges drew
upon both the original Latin text and the German text the tune was written for.  The result was not a direct
translation of either of those texts; but a paraphrase that beautifully fit the meter of the tune.

## Tune
Partially based on earlier melodies (including the Genevan tune for Psalm 23), HERZ LIEBSTER JESU was composed by
Johann Crüger (b.1598 - d.1662) and published in his Neues vollkömliches Gesangbuch (1640). Johann S. Bach used the
tune in both his St. Matthew Passion and St. John Passion, and various other composers have written preludes on the
chorale.

HERZLIEBSTER JESU is a sober tune in minor tonality; it provides a strong match for Heermann's text.

## About This Version
We chose to largely follow the Bridges translation; including the use of Elizabethan English.  However, we did revise
certain phrases that are particularly archaic so that modern English speakers are more likely to understand.  For
example, in the original text, verse one reads: "Ah, holy Jesu, how hast though offended, That man to judge thee hath
in hate pretended?".  This was rephrased as: "Ah, holy Jesus, how hast Thou offended, That mortal judgment hath on Thee
descended".  The meaning of "pretended" in the original uses a very uncommon meaning of the word; and we feared that
few would understand the real meaning of that passage of the hymn.
