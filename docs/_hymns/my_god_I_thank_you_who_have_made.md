lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "My God, I thank You, who have made"
    - "The earth so bright."
    - "So full of spendor and of joy."
    - "Beauty and light;"
    - "So many glorious things are here,"
    - "Noble and right."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "I thank You, too, that You have made"
    - "Joy to abound;"
    - "So many gentle thoughts and deeds"
    - "Circling us round,"
    - "That in the darkest spot of earth"
    - "Some love is found."
  - name: "Verse 3"
    lines:
    - "I thank You more that all our joy"
    - "Is touched with pain,"
    - "The shadows fall on brightest hours."
    - "That thorns remain;"
    - "So that earth's bliss may be our guide"
    - "And not our chain."
  - name: "Verse 4"
    lines:
    - "For You who knows, O Lord, how soon"
    - "Our weak heart clings,"
    - "Have giv'n us joys, tender and true,"
    - "Yet all with wings;"
    - "So that we see gleaming on high"
    - "Diviner things."
  - name: "Verse 5"
    lines:
    - "I thank You, Lord, that You have kept"
    - "The best in store;"
    - "We have enough, yet not too much"
    - "To long for more;"
    - "A yearning for a deeper peace"
    - "Not known before."
  - name: "Verse 6"
    lines:
    - "I thank You, Lord, that here our souls,"
    - "Though amply blessed,"
    - "Can never find, although they seek,"
    - "A perfect rest;"
    - "Nor ever shall, until they lean"
    - "On Jesus' breast."
