lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "How beautiful the hands that served the wine and the bread, and the sons of the earth."
    - "How beautiful the feet that walked the long dusty roads, and the hill to the cross."
    - "How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, is the body of Christ."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "How beautiful the heart that bled that took all my sin, and bore it instead."
    - "How beautiful the tender eyes the choose to forgive, and never despise."
    - "How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, is the body of Christ."
  - name: "Bridge"
    lines:
    - "And as He laid down His life,"
    - "we offer this sacrifice,"
    - "that we might live just as He died:"
    - "willing to pay the price,"
    - "willing to pay the price."
  - name: "Verse 3"
    lines:
    - "How beautiful the radiant bride who waits for the groom with His light in her eyes."
    - "How beautiful when humble hearts give the fruit of pure lives so that others may live."
    - "How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, is the body of Christ."
  - name: "Verse 4"
    lines:
    - "How beautiful the feet that bring the sound of good news, and the love of the King."
    - "How beautiful the hands that serve the wine and the bread, and the sons of the earth."
    - "How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, is the body of Christ."
