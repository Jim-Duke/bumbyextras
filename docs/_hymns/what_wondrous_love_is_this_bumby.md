  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul,"
    - "what wondrous love is this, O my soul!"
    - "What wondrous love is this,"
    - "that caused the Lord of bliss,"
    - "to bear the dreadful curse, for my soul, for my soul,"
    - "to bear the dreadful curse, for my soul!"
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down,"
    - "when I was sinking down, sinking down;"
    - "when I was sinking down,"
    - "beneath God's righteous frown,"
    - "Christ laid aside his crown, for my soul, for my soul,"
    - "Christ laid aside his crown, for my soul!"
  - name: "Verse 3"
    lines:
    - "To God and to the Lamb, I will sing, I will sing,"
    - "to God and to the Lamb, I will sing!"
    - "To God and to the Lamb,"
    - "who is the great \"I AM,\""
    - "while millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing,"
    - "while millions join the theme, I will sing."
  - name: "Verse 4"
    lines:
    - "And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on, I'll sing on,"
    - "and when from death I'm free, I'll sing on!"
    - "And when from death I'm free,"
    - "I'll sing and joyful be,"
    - "and through eternity, I'll sing on, I'll sing on,"
    - "and through eternity, I'll sing on."
