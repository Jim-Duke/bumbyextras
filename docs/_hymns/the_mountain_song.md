lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "O Lord, I need a mountain to climb on;"
    - "Just a quiet place to go and know You're there."
    - "O Lord, I need to spend some time with You;"
    - "Spend the night with You, dear Lord, in prayer."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "O Lord, I tho't the day would never dawn,"
    - "When I'd lay my burdens down and walk with You;"
    - "But this morning as I met the rising sun;"
    - "I felt, dear Lord, my dreams had all come true."
  - name: "Chorus"
    lines:
    - "And the greatest Friend you'll ever find is on a lonely mountain."
    - "And the highest high you'll ever feel is when you kneel to pray."
    - "And the brightest light you'll ever see is when you close your eyes."
    - "O Lord, You are my first love; at last I realize."
