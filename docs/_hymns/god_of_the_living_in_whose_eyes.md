lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "God of the living, in whose eyes,"
    - "Unveiled thy whole creation lies,"
    - "All souls are thine; we must not say"
    - "That those are dead who pass away,"
    - "From this our world of flesh set free;"
    - "We know them living unto thee."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "Released from earthly toil and strife,"
    - "With thee is hidden still their life;"
    - "Thine are their thoughts, their works, their powers,"
    - "All thine, and yet most truly ours,"
    - "For well we know, where'er they be,"
    - "Our dead are living unto thee."
  - name: "Verse 3"
    lines:
    - "Not spilt like water on the ground,"
    - "Not wrapped in dreamless sleep profound,"
    - "Not wandering in unknown despair,"
    - "Beyond thy voice, thine arm, thy care;"
    - "Not left to lie like fallen tree;"
    - "Not dead, but living unto thee."
  - name: "Verse 4"
    lines:
    - "Thy word is true, thy will is just;"
    - "To thee we leave them, Lord, in trust;"
    - "And bless thee for the love which gave"
    - "Thy Son to fill a human grave,"
    - "That none might fear that world to see"
    - "Where all are living unto thee."
  - name: "Verse 5"
    lines:
    - "O Breather into man of breath,"
    - "O Holder of the keys of death,"
    - "O Giver of the life within,"
    - "Save us from death, the death of sin;"
    - "That body, soul, and spirit be"
    - "Forever living unto thee!"
