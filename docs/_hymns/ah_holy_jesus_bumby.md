lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    lines:
    - "Ah, holy Jesus, how hast Thou offended,"
    - "That mortal judgment hath on Thee descended?"
    - "By foes derided, by Thin own rejected,"
    - "O most afflicted."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    lines:
    - "Who was the guilty? Who brought this upon Thee?"
    - "It is my treason, Lord, that hath undone Thee."
    - "'Twas I, Lord Jesus, I it was denied Thee;"
    - "I crucified Thee."
  - name: "Verse 3"
    lines:
    - "Lo, the Good Shepherd for the sheep is offered;"
    - "The slave hath sinned, and the Son hath suffered."
    - "For my atonement, though I nothing heeded,"
    - "God interceded."
  - name: "Verse 4"
    lines:
    - "For me, kind Jesus, was Thy incarnation,"
    - "Thy mortal sorrow, and Thy life's oblation;"
    - "Thy death of anguish and Thy bitter passion,"
    - "For my salvation."
  - name: "Verse 5"
    lines:
    - "Therefore, dear Jesus, since I cannot pay Thee,"
    - "I do adore Thee, and will ever pray Thee."
    - "Think on Thy pity and Thy love unswerving."
    - "Not my deserving."
