lyrics:
  - name: "Verse 1"
    style: alternating-indent
    lines:
    - "My Shepherd, will supply my need;"
    - "Jehovah is His name."
    - "In pastures fresh He makes me feed,"
    - "beside the living stream."
    - "He brings my wand'ring spirit back"
    - "when I forsake His ways,"
    - "And leads me, for His mercy's sake,"
    - "in paths of truth and grace."
  - name: "Verse 2"
    style: alternating-indent
    lines:
    - "When I walk through the shades of death,"
    - "His presence is my stay;"
    - "A word of His supporting breath"
    - "drives all my fears away."
    - "His hand, in sight of all my foes,"
    - "does still my table spread;"
    - "My cup with blessings overflows,"
    - "His oil anoints my head."
  - name: "Verse 3"
    style: alternating-indent
    lines:
    - "The sure provisions of my God"
    - "attend me all my days;"
    - "Oh, may His house be my abode"
    - "and all my work be praise!"
    - "There would I find a settled rest,"
    - "(while others go and come);"
    - "No more a stranger or a guest,"
    - "but like a child at home."
