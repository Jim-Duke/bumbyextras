<h1>Bumby Hymnal Project</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Bumby Hymnal Project website.  On this site you can monitor
the status of the various hymns the Bumby Hymnal Project is working on, and
read about songs that have been completed.  For Public Domain Songs we will
provide full access to the finished materials, which will include PDF's of
sheet music, slides, and a collection of MP3 files that can be used as
training aids to learn the song.  You can read more about the project on our
<a href="about">About</a> page.</p>
